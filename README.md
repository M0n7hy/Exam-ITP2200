To run the code and to check overall coverage you have to press run with coverage on each test class and you will get a box asking to show that class' coverage or 
add it to the rest.

There can be problems running the code if the placement of the project folder is incorrect. For example placing it directly on the desktop. 
A fix to this can be to make a empty folder and put the project folder inside then run the code.
